Tulip python utility classes used to process discussion forum data

## Utility classes

Code in this repository should always come in pairs: a python class that can be imported as such into a python script, or a python Tulip plugin that can be imported in the [Tulip GUI](http://tulip.labri.fr "Tulip - Data Visualization Software / Better Visualization through Research").

(Pairs of) code files follow the naming convention:

*   \<UtilityClass\>.py (FabulousMetric.py, for instance)
*   \<UtilityClass\>Plugin.py (FabulousMetricPlugin.py, for instance)
