# opencare_workspace
Code archive / ongoing socio-semantic analysis work

The opencare project is committed to building a web dashboard for the analysis of semantic social networks. 
Semantic social networks are social networks of interaction whose edges carry meaning. 
This is pre-release code, data and images generated as a waypoint towards the dashboard. 
Guy Melan√ßon and Alberto Cottica are maintaining it.
Feel free to jump in and ask questions or fork, but we can't commit to high quality documentation yet.
